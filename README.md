Min Variance Model and Equal Risk Contribution Model for portfolio optimization

We first studied the min variance model.
We created an Excel file containing all the returns-volatilities data of the CAC 40 companies. We wanted to minimize the volatility under the yield constraint. We could find the weight of each stock to minimize the volatility.
We backtested our investment strategy. It examined the yield and volatility achieved with our weights obtained in previous periods. 

In a second step, we studied the Equal Risk contribution model: each share must contribute equitably to the risk of the portfolio.
Although, I did not find ways to compute the weights by removing the independence of the evolution of the stock prices, which is obviously wrong but allowed me to move forward.

Portfolio returns with the ERC model and the Min-Variance model are compared to determine the most performant one.
